# Activity 1: Sending Requests to Our APIs Using Postman

Now that we have learned how to use Postman, we are going to test our application using Postman instead of the curl/httpie command-line testing tools. In this activity, we will be using this tool to test the CRUD functions in our web service:

1. **Create a request in Postman and get all the recipes.**
2. **Use a POST request to create a recipe.**
3. **Create a request to get all the recipes.**
4. **Send an update request to modify the recipe that we have just created.**
5. **Send a request to get a specific recipe.**
6. **Send a request to search for a recipe that doesn't exist.**
